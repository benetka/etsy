# Etsy - Jupyter notebook instead of CV

Last year, there was an [opening at Etsy for an internship](https://www.etsy.com/au/careers) in their data science team. 
I decided to give it a try, because I thought that it would be really cool to have a chance to see and to work on the [challenges 
they're facing](https://codeascraft.com). I hate writing long texts about myself but I fancy playing with data, 
so I decided to send a [Jupyter notebook with a quick data analysis](https://github.com/benetka/etsy/blob/master/I%20want%20to%20intern%20at%20Etsy!.ipynb) as my CV and motivation letter in one. 
I didn't get the position, but why not to share the notebook anyway? BTW, I ended up going to Microsoft Research in Redmond that summer.
